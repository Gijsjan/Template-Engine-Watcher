Template Engine Watcher
==

You develop locally using template engines like Coffee, Jade and Stylus, but you don't want to convert the files by hand and client side js convertors are slow (especially when you use several). TEW is very simple: watches the directories where your template engine files are in and converts them when you make a change.

+ Download/copy watch.js
+ Replace the base and out paths
+ If you need to add an engine, just add an object and add it to the convertors array
+ Run with Node.js using 'node watch.js'

Enjoy!
